# MITRE Cybersecurity Frameworks Lab
<b>Platform:</b> TryHackMe | <b>Type:</b> Hands-On Lab | <b>Focus:</b> Adversary Behavior, Detection Analytics, Defensive Techniques
<h2>Overview:</h2>
In this lab, I explored a wide range of cybersecurity frameworks developed by MITRE, including:
<li><b>MITRE ATT&CK®</b>– Describing adversary behavior through tactics and techniques</li>
<li><b>MITRE D3FEND™</b>– A knowledge base of defensive techniques mapped to adversary tactics</li>
<li><b>MITRE Engage™</b>– Strategies for adversary engagement and deception</li>
<li><b>Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR)</b>– A repository of behavioral analytics for threat detection</li>
<li><b>ATT&CK Emulation Plans</b>– Simulations of known APT group behaviors to improve defensive readiness</li>
<h2>What I Learned:</h2>
<li>How to map real-world cyber threats using the <b>ATT&CK Matrix</b></li>
<li>How to use <b>ATT&CK Navigator</b> to visually analyze TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)</li>
<li>The role of <b>CAR</b> in developing behavioral analytics for tools like Splunk and Zeek</li>
<li>The importance of <b>D3FEND</b> in identifying specific countermeasures to adversary techniques</li>
<li>How <b>Engage</b> helps design proactive defense strategies and adversary interaction plans</li>
<li>The value of <b>emulation plans</b> in testing blue team readiness against known APTs</li>
<h2>Skills Gained:</h2>
<li>Threat modeling and analysis</li>
<li>Defensive and offensive framework comprehension</li>
<li>Practical use of MITRE Navigator and related tools</li>
<li>Threat intelligence mapping and reporting</li>
<h2>Outcome:</h2>
This lab strengthened my ability to use standardized frameworks to interpret and respond to cybersecurity threats. I can now confidently integrate MITRE-based practices into detection engineering, incident response, and blue teaming strategies.
