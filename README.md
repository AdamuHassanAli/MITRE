# MITRE Cybersecurity Frameworks Lab
<b>Platform:</b> TryHackMe | <b>Type:</b> Hands-On Lab | <b>Focus:</b> Adversary Behavior, Detection Analytics, Defensive Techniques
<h2>Overview:</h2>
In this lab, I explored a wide range of cybersecurity frameworks developed by MITRE, including:
<li><b>MITRE ATT&CK®</b>– Describing adversary behavior through tactics and techniques</li>
<li><b>MITRE D3FEND™</b>– A knowledge base of defensive techniques mapped to adversary tactics</li>
<li><b>MITRE Engage™</b>– Strategies for adversary engagement and deception</li>
<li><b>Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR)</b>– A repository of behavioral analytics for threat detection</li>
<li><b>ATT&CK Emulation Plans</b>– Simulations of known APT group behaviors to improve defensive readiness</li>

What I Learned:

How to map real-world cyber threats using the ATT&CK Matrix

How to use ATT&CK Navigator to visually analyze TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)

The role of CAR in developing behavioral analytics for tools like Splunk and Zeek

The importance of D3FEND in identifying specific countermeasures to adversary techniques

How Engage helps design proactive defense strategies and adversary interaction plans

The value of emulation plans in testing blue team readiness against known APTs

Skills Gained:

Threat modeling and analysis

Defensive and offensive framework comprehension

Practical use of MITRE Navigator and related tools

Threat intelligence mapping and reporting

Outcome:
This lab strengthened my ability to use standardized frameworks to interpret and respond to cybersecurity threats. I can now confidently integrate MITRE-based practices into detection engineering, incident response, and blue teaming strategies.
